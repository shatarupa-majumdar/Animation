            <p> Materials form an integral part of the way composite structures perform. Because the builder is creating a structural material from diverse constituent compounds, material science concepts are essential to the understanding of how structural composites behave. There are three broad groups of composite materials[1,2];

• Core Materials

2.1. Reinforcement Materials: Fiberglass

Glass fibers account for over 90% of the fibers used in reinforced plastics because they are inexpensive to produce and have relatively good strength to weight characteristics. Additionally, glass fibers exhibit good chemical resistance and processability. The excellent tensile strength of glass fibers, however, may deteriorate when loads are applied for long periods of time[3,5]. Continuous glass fibers are formed by extruding molten glass to filament diameters between 5-25 micrometers. Individual filaments are coated with a sizing to reduce abrasion and then combined into a strand of either 102 or 204 filaments. The sizing acts as a coupling agent during resin impregnation. E-glass (lime aluminum borosilicate) is the most common reinforcement used in marine laminates because of its good strength properties and resistance to water degradation. S-glass (silicon dioxide, aluminum and magnesium oxides) exhibits about one third better tensile strength, and in general, demonstrates better fatigue resistance. The cost for this variety of glass fiber (data on raw E-glass and S-glass fibers) is about three to four times that of E-glass as shown in the table 1.

2.3. Spectra

Allied Corporation developed a high strength/modulus extended chain polyethylene fiber called Spectra® that was introduced in 1985. Room temperature specific mechanical properties of Spectra®®are slightly better than Kevlar although performance at elevated temperatures falls off. Chemical and wear resistance data is superior to the aramids. Data for both Kevlar® and Spectra® fibers is also contained in Table 1.

2.4. Polyester and Nylon

Polyester and nylon thermoplastic fibers have recently been introduced to the marine industry as primary reinforcements and in a hybrid arrangement with fiberglass. Allied Corporation has developed a fiber called COMPET®, which is the product of applying a finish to PET fibers that enhances matrix adhesion properties[7,8].

2.5. Treveria

Hoechst-Celanese manufactures a product called Treveria®, which is a heat treated polyester fiber fabric designed as a “bulking” material and as a gel coat barrier to reduce “print-through.” Although polyester fibers have fairly high strengths, their stiffness is considerably below that of glass[10]. Other attractive features include low density, reasonable cost, good impact and fatigue resistance, and potential for vibration damping and blister resistance.

2.6. Carbon Fibers

The terms “carbon” and “graphite” fibers are typically used interchangeably, although graphite technically refers to fibers that are greater than 99% carbon composition versus 93 to 95% for PAN-base fibers. All continuous carbon fibers produced to date are made from organic precursors[11,13], which in addition to PAN (polyacrylonitrile), include rayon and pitches, with the latter two generally used for low modulus fibers. Carbon fibers offer the highest strength and stiffness of all commonly used reinforcement fibers. The fibers are not subject to stress rupture or stress corrosion, as with glass and aramids. High temperature performance is particularly outstanding. The major drawback to the PAN-base fibers is their relative cost, which is a function of high precursor costs and an energy intensive manufacturing process</p>
